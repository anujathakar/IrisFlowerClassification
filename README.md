# IrisFlowerClassification
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification task using the classic Iris dataset. We build a Decision Tree classifier to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features.

#The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

#The goal is to classify each flower into one of three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

#Technologies & Libraries Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib (optional for visualizations)

#The dataset is provided by sklearn.datasets.load_iris() and is built into Scikit-learn. It contains:

Features: Numeric data (lengths and widths)

Labels: 0, 1, 2 representing 3 flower species
